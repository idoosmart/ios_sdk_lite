# IDOSDK-lite



## Installation



### From CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like `IDOSDK-lite` in your projects. First, add the following line to your [Podfile](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html):

```ruby
pod 'IDOSDK-lite'
```

If you want to use the latest features of `IDOSDK-lite` use normal external source dependencies.

```ruby
pod 'IDOSDK-lite', :git => 'https://github.com/idoosmart/ios_sdk_lite.git'
```

This pulls from the `main` branch directly.

Second, install `IDOSDK-lite` into your project:

```shell
pod install
```
